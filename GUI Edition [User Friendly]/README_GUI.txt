The user-friendly edition of the RDBMS, features a nice Graphical User Interface that I built using wxWidgets and integrated the command-line edition into it.

Mainly for practice with GUI programming and namely wxWidgets.

NOTE: Requires wxWidgets installed and properly configured in order to link and compile correctly.
