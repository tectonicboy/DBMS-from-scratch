A free-time project that sees me making a custom relational database management system from scratch in C++, whose primary aim is to improve my programming skills. Includes my own custom SQL syntax and an Interpreter for it and a save state subsystem where databases can be saved by generating all vital information about them into a text file encoded in a custom output format I came up, and then previously saved databases can be loaded when the system is started later.
