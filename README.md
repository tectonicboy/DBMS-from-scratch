A free-time project that sees me making a custom relational database management system from scratch in C++, whose primary aim is to improve my programming skills. Includes my own custom SQL language and an Interpreter for it and a save state subsystem where databases can be saved by generating all vital information about them into a text file encoded in a custom output format I came up with, and then previously saved databases can be loaded when the system is started later by reading the generated text file.

The database system is able to communicate with other processes on the same machine (such as a web server, the way I'm using it in my Cloud Storage Tool web dev project) it's running on via an AF_UNIX local interprocess communication socket. This can be disabled by commenting out a line in cMain.cpp that starts the std::thread which runs the function that initializes the socket functionality.
